<h1>UnGateway Introduction</h1>
<p>
UnGateway is a system that provides additional methods for server 
administration. It's a base system that can easily be extended to support
additional protocols.
</p>
<p>
At the moment it provides a Telnet server with VT102 terminal emulation, it 
behaves much like the Bash shell.<br />
The telnet server has been tested with the Linux telnet client and a MS Windows
telnet client: PuTTY. The MS Telnet client that comes with every MS Windows
version also works, but it's advised to use a different telnet client (like 
PuTTY, free software).
</p>
<p>
Security notice: the telnet protocol is plain text, there is no form of 
encryption. On the side note: the UT2004 webadmin does not have any better
protection.
</p>
<p>
Additionally from version 102 beta the IRC daemon is also functional. The IRC
server works pretty much like any other IRC server, so a normal IRC client 
should work.<br />
Not every function of the IRC protocol has been implemented, but at the moment
it's functional.
