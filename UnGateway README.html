<h1>UnGateway</h1>
version 102 Beta<br />

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
UnGateway is a system that provides additional methods for server 
administration. It's a base system that can easily be extended to support
additional protocols.
</p>
<p>
At the moment it provides a Telnet server with VT102 terminal emulation, it 
behaves much like the Bash shell.<br />
The telnet server has been tested with the Linux telnet client and a MS Windows
telnet client: PuTTY. The MS Telnet client that comes with every MS Windows
version also works, but it's advised to use a different telnet client (like 
PuTTY, free software).
</p>
<p>
Security notice: the telnet protocol is plain text, there is no form of 
encryption. On the side note: the UT2004 webadmin does not have any better
protection.
</p>
<p>
Additionally from version 102 beta the IRC daemon is also functional. The IRC
server works pretty much like any other IRC server, so a normal IRC client 
should work.<br />
Not every function of the IRC protocol has been implemented, but at the moment
it's functional.
</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>
Copy the .u and .int files to the System directory.<br />
Add the following to your system configuration (UT2004.ini):
<pre>
[Engine.GameEngine]
ServerActors=UnGateway.GatewayDaemon
</pre>
This is all you need to install the system. Now you will have to configure the interfaces and applications.

<h2>Configuration</h2>
<h3>Applications</h3>
<p>
Applications contain the commands you can enter into the system. There are a couple of application included with the system.<br />
To install a application to have to add it to the application list of the GatewatDaemon in the system configuration:
<pre>
[UnGateway.GatewayDaemon]
ApplicationClasses=&lt;application class 1&gt;
ApplicationClasses=&lt;application class 2&gt;
ApplicationClasses=...
</pre>
You can add as many application classes as you want.
</p>
<p>
The following application classes are included with the system:
<table>
<tr>
	<th>class name</th><th>description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><code>UnGateway.GAppDebug</code></td><td>Contains debug commands, there's no need to install this application</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><code>UnGateway.GAppDefault</code></td><td>Contain default commands like "help" and "quit"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><code>UnGateway.GAppCron</code></td><td>Provides a cron daemon to program commands to be executed at a set time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><code>UGUT2004.GAppSystem</code></td><td>Provides general system commands for UT2004, like shutdown and servertravel</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><code>UGUT2004.GAppSettings</code></td><td>Contains commands to change settings and maplists</td>
</tr>
</table>
For an overview of all available commands and some additional information checkt the UnGateway-help.html file
</p>

<h3>Interfaces</h3>
<p>
Out of the box UnGateway doesn't do much. You need to configure interfaces and 
applications that are available. To add an interface add the following to your 
system configuration:
<pre>
[UnGateway.GatewayDaemon]
InterfaceClasses=&lt;interface class 1&gt;
InterfaceClasses=&lt;interface class 2&gt;
InterfaceClasses=...
</pre>
</p>
<p>
The following interface classes are available:
<table>
<tr>
	<th>class name</th><th>description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><code>UnGateway.GITelnetd</code></td><td>Telnet server, emulates a VT102 terminal server</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><code>UnGateway.GIIRCd</code></td><td>IRC server</td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>

<h3>Other options</h3>
Besides the interfaces and the applications you can also change the following setting. However, most of these don't require any changes.
<pre>
[UnGateway.GatewayDaemon]
Verbose=0
AuthClass=UnGateway.GAuthSystem
CmdAliases=(alias="reboot",command="shutdown now \"restarting the server, please return in a couple of second\"")
CmdAliases=(alias="p",command="players %@")
...
</pre>

<dl>
	<dt>Verbose<dt>
	<dd>This sets the log verbosity. It's a binary list of flags: Error = 1; Warning = 2; Info = 4; Event = 8; Debug = 128. You probably only want to set the Error flag and maybe the Warning flag.</dd>

	<dt>AuthClass</dt>
	<dd>This is the authentication system used to authenticate the logins. The system comes with one system <code>UnGateway.GAuthSystem</code>, this will just used the UT2004's AccessControll class to validate the logins.</dd>

	<dt>CmdAliases</dt>
	<dd>This will allow you to create aliases for certain commands. You can have as many aliases as you want, you can only use real commands in the command value of the alias. Aliases have a higher priority than the actual commands. these aliases are system wide, so every user can use these aliases. By default no aliases have been configured.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>General interface configuration</h3>
Each interface has the following configuration options. Additional configuration options may be available per interface.

<pre>
iListenPort=0
bUseNextAvailable=false
iMaxClients=10
AccessPolicy=(hostmask="*",policy=AP_Allow)
...
</pre>

<dl>
	<dt>iListenPort</dt>
	<dd>The TCP port to listen on for incoming connections. By default the built-in interfaces have not configured any listen port. So you will have to set them up correctly before you start the server.</dd>

	<dt>bUseNextAvailable</dt>
	<dd>If the listen port is already in use, use the next available port to bind to. It's adviced to set this value to false.</dd>

	<dt>iMaxClients</dt>
	<dd>The maximum number of clients allowed. If the max has been reached, new clients will be denied.</dd>

	<dt>AccessPolicy</dt>
	<dd>This controlls from which IP mask client may or may not connect from. The default policy is to accept clients from any IP mask. The order of the AccessPolicy is important, the last match has the final ruling.<br />
	The hostmask can contain the following wildcards: * = zero or more matches; ? = one single character. <br />
	The policy can either be <code>AP_Allow</code> or <code>AP_Deny</code></dd>
</dl>

<h2>Application configuration</h2>
Some applications have configurable options. Unless stated otherwise, all configurations belong in the system configuration.

<h3>UnGateway.GAppCron</h3>
<p>
<pre>
[UnGateway.GAppCron]
CronClass=UnGateway.Cron
</pre>
<dl>
	<dt>CronClass</dt>
	<dd>the Cron daemon class, no need to change this</dd>
</dl>
</p>

<h4>UnGateway.Cron</h4>

...
</pre>
<dl>
	<dt>DummyClientClass</dt>
	<dd>The dummy client used to capture the output of commands. No need to change this</dd>

	<dt>Crontab</dt>
	<dd>The cron configuration. You can add as many cron entries as you want.<br />
	<table>
	<tr>
		<th>field</th><th>description</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Command</td><td>the command to secute</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Type</td><td><code>EC_Delay</code> or <code>EC_Time</code></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Time</td><td>time configuration, format depends on the value of Type.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Desc</td><td>description</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>bDisabled</td><td>when true the command will never be executed</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
	<dl>
		<dt><code>EC_Delay</code></dt>
		<dd>The command will be executed after set number of minutes after the level has been loaded.</dd>

		<dt><code>EC_Time</code></dt>
		<dd>The command will be executed when the set time has been	reached. <br />
		Time field format, 5 fields: <code>minute hour day month day_of_week</code>
		<table>
		<tr>
			<td>minute:</td><td>0-59</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>hour:</td><td>0-23</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>

		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>month:</td><td>0-11</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>day_of_week:</td><td>0-6</td>
		</tr>
		</table>
 	A * can be used as wild card. Optionally each field can have a divider for
	re-occurance: val/div. For example a field has the value: "0/5". This means
	that it will match: time % div == val -> time % 5 == 0. If time is minutes
	then it will match every 5 minutes, 1/5 will also match every 5 minutes,
	except that it's the 2nd minute of every 5 minutes, 5/5 will never match. A
	wildcard in a divider will be changed to 0: * /5 -> 0/5, 0/ * -> 0/0 (never
	matches)

	</dl>
	</dd>
</dl>

	When logged in you can use the following commands to change the chat
	mode:
	<table>
	<tr>
		<td><code>Alt+c</code></td><td>toggle partial chat mode</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><code>Alt+C</code></td><td>full chat mode</td>

</dl>

<h2>Usage</h2>
Ofcourse each interface work differently.

<h3>Telnet</h3>
<p>
Any telnet client should work with the telnet server, however for MS Window I advise you to use the free client PuTTY. It's much better than the standard MS Telnet client.
</p>
<p>
The rest of the system works pretty much like a GNU BASH shell. Here's an overview of all special keyboard commands:
<table>
<tr>
	<th>key</th><th>description</th>
</tr>
<tr><td><code>backspace</code></td><td>delete the previous character</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>tab</code></td><td>perform tab completion to complete the current command. <br />Note: currently this only works for the commands, not the command parameters</td></tr>

<tr><td><code>Alt+c</code></td><td>toggle partial chat mode</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>Alt+C</code></td><td>enter full chat mode. to exit the full chat mode press <code>Ctrl+D</code></td></tr>

<tr><td><code>Ctrl+A</code></td><td>move the cursor to the beginning of the line</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>Ctrl+D</code></td><td>delete the next character, on an empty line: logout</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>Ctrl+E</code></td><td>move the cursor to the end of the line</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>Ctrl+K</code></td><td>cut the text from the cursor to the end of the line to the clipboard</td></tr>

<tr><td><code>Ctrl+Y</code></td><td>paste the current clipboard buffer</td></tr>

<tr><td><code>Arrow down</code></td><td>scroll forward in the history</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>Arrow left</code></td><td>move the cursor to the left</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>Arrow right</code></td><td>move the cursor to the right</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>Arrow up</code></td><td>scroll back in the history</td></tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>
By default the internal pager is enbaled. This means if a command shows more information that you have room on your screen it will start the pager that will allow you to scroll up (<code>PageUp</code>) and scroll down (<code>PageDown</code>) to view all data. To exit the pager either press <code>Ctrl+C</code> or <code>Q</code>.
</p>


<h3>IRC</h3>
<p>
The IRC server works pretty much like any other IRC server. However not all functionality is has been implemented.<br />
By default two channels are created, the game channel and the admin channel (&Admin). The name of the game channel is contructed from the server's IP and port. By default the available IRC channels are listed in the MOTD, otherwise you can use the <code>/list</code> command to list all available channels.
</p>

<h4>Game channel</h4>
The game channel is much like a normal IRC channel, by default everything you say will be said on the server, and vice versa. The players in the game join and part this channel automatically.

<h4>Admin channel (&Admin)</h4>
The admin channel is a special channel (and only local on a server) where you can enter the UnGateway commands. These commands have to be prefixed with a <code>.</code> (a period). Commands not prefixed with a <code>.</code> will just be said on the admin channel, other IRC admins logged in on this channel will also see this.<br />
The admin channel is only available to logged in admins.

<h4>Logging in</h4>
There are two ways you can log in. If you specify a password during login the system will automatically try to log you in as an admin. If you don't specify a password you will log in as a normal user. <br />
To log in as an admin you will have to use the <code>/oper</code> command.<br />
When you are logged in as an IRC Oper/Admin you will be able to join the Admin channel, and you can see the complete user details when using <code>/whois</code>.
